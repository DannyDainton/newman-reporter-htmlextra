A [Newman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman) HTML reporter that has been extended to include the separation of the iteration runs so these are no longer aggregated together and also some additional `handlebars helpers` to enable users to create better custom templates. This reporter comes with a default dashboard style template and also a `Dark Theme` version.

---

## Some of the Extras

- Full separated iterations runs and not aggregated stats - Default template shows iteration number in heading
- Includes the full [handlebars-helpers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars-helpers) module for building better templates
- New `percent` helper to help exposing data like `Test Pass Percentage` - e.g `{{percent cumulativeTests.passed cumulativeTests.failed}}`
- Copy and Paste any of the Response Bodies
- Includes an `inc` helper to work with things like the handlebars zero index - e.g `Iteration:{{inc cursor.iteration}} - {{item.name}}`
- Added the [helper-moment](https://github.com/helpers/helper-moment) module so you have more control over the display dates - e.g `{{moment date format="dddd, DD MMMM YYYY HH:mm:ss"}}`
- Exposed the `Skipped Tests` so you can tell which ones are skipped, in the main summary view. You can also see which tests are skipped within the single request view
- Folder level descriptions with rendered Markdown syntax
- Response Headers displayed for each of the requests
- Iterations separated by tabs in the `Requests` view
- The `console.log` statements from the Collections can be seen using the `--reporter-htmlextra-logs` CLI flag - These will be part of each of the requests that have them.
- A `Dark Theme` dashboard template - This is an option from the CLI using the `--reporter-htmlextra-darkTheme` flag or in a script by setting the `darkTheme` property to `true`.
- A `helper` to give more control over the main `title` shown on the report. Use the `--reporter-htmlextra-title` flag to add your own unique headline.
- The default filename, if you do not supply the `export` location, is now includes the collection name in the filename rather that the reporter name.
- Use the `onlyShowFails` option to reduce the report down to just showing the requests that had test failures.
- The `skipHeaders` option lets you optionally specify an array of header names that should be skipped in the report.
- Setting the `skipSensitiveData` will skip outputting the headers and bodies for all requests and responses.
- More to come...

## Interactive Report Examples

To give you an idea of what the final reports will look like, I've added a couple of working examples here:

- [All the Tests Passing](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/newman-htmlextra-reports/All_Passed.html)
- [Passing and Failing Iterations](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/newman-htmlextra-reports/Passing_And_Failing.html)

These a _just_ a couple of the reports that can be produced from the reporter. You will find more options available to help configure the final output, in the sections below.

## Install

> The installation should be global if newman is installed globally, local otherwise.

For `global` install:

```console
npm install -g newman-reporter-htmlextra
```

For `local` install:

```console
npm install -S newman-reporter-htmlextra
```
---

## Usage

In order to enable this reporter, specify `htmlextra` in Newman's `-r` or `--reporters` option.

```console
newman run https://www.getpostman.com/collections/631643-f695cab7-6878-eb55-7943-ad88e1ccfd65-JsLv -r htmlextra
```

### CLI Options

#### With Newman CLI

| CLI Option  | Description       |
|-------------|-------------------|
| `--reporter-htmlextra-export <path>` | Specify a path where the output HTML file will be written to disk. If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory. |
| `--reporter-htmlextra-template <path>` | Specify a path to the custom template which will be used to render the HTML report. This option depends on `--reporter htmlextra` and `--reporter-htmlextra-export` being present in the run command. If this option is not specified, the [default template](./lib/dashboard-template.hbs) is used |
| `--reporter-htmlextra-showOnlyFails` | Use this optional flag to tell the reporter to display only the requests with failed tests. |
| `--reporter-htmlextra-darkTheme` | Use this optional flag to switch the reporter template to the `Dark Theme` dashboard. |
| `--reporter-htmlextra-testPaging` | Use this optional flag to add pagination to the tests in the request view. |
| `--reporter-htmlextra-browserTitle` | Use this optional flag to change the name of the title in the browser tab. The default name is "Newman Summary Report". |
| `--reporter-htmlextra-title` | This optional flag can be used to give your report a different main `Title` in the centre of the report. If this is not set, the report will show "Newman Run Dashboard". |
| `--reporter-htmlextra-titleSize` | An optional flag to reduce the size of the main report title. The sizes range from `1` to `6`, the higher the number, the smaller the title will be. The default size is `2`. |
| `--reporter-htmlextra-logs` | This optional flag shows any console log statements in the collection, on the final report. This is `false` by default. |
| `--reporter-htmlextra-hideResponse` | An optional flag which allows you to exclude certain `Response Bodies` from the final report |
| `--reporter-htmlextra-skipHeaders` | An optional flag which allows you to exclude certain `Headers` from the final report |
| `--reporter-htmlextra-omitHeaders` | An optional flag which allows you to exclude all `Headers` from the final report |
| `--reporter-htmlextra-skipSensitiveData` | An optional flag that will exclude all the `Request/Response Headers` and the `Request/Response bodies`, from each request in the final report. This will only show the main request info and the Test Results. This is `false` by default. |
| `--reporter-htmlextra-noSyntaxHighlighting` | An optional flag which allows you disable the code syntax highlighting. This _could_ enhance the performance of opening larger reports. |

Custom templates (currently handlebars only) can be passed to the HTML reporter via `--reporter-htmlextra-template <path>` with `--reporters htmlextra` and `--reporter-htmlextra-export`.
The [default template](./lib/dashboard-template.hbs) is used in all other cases.

To create a report that only shows the requests with `Failed` tests, from the CLI, the following command can be used:

```console
newman run https://www.getpostman.com/collections/631643-f695cab7-6878-eb55-7943-ad88e1ccfd65-JsLv -r htmlextra --reporter-htmlextra-showOnlyFails
```

To create the `Dark Theme` report from the CLI, the following command can be used:

```console
newman run https://www.getpostman.com/collections/631643-f695cab7-6878-eb55-7943-ad88e1ccfd65-JsLv -r htmlextra --reporter-htmlextra-darkTheme
```

To add a custom `Title` to your report from the CLI, the following command can be used:

```console
newman run https://www.getpostman.com/collections/631643-f695cab7-6878-eb55-7943-ad88e1ccfd65-JsLv -r htmlextra --reporter-htmlextra-title "My new report title"
```

To show the `console.log()` statements on the report from the CLI, the following command can be used:

```console
newman run https://www.getpostman.com/collections/631643-f695cab7-6878-eb55-7943-ad88e1ccfd65-JsLv -r htmlextra --reporter-htmlextra-logs
```

To exclude a certain `Header` from the final report, the following command can be used:

```console
newman run https://www.getpostman.com/collections/631643-f695cab7-6878-eb55-7943-ad88e1ccfd65-JsLv --folder 'Authentication Methods' -r htmlextra --reporter-htmlextra-skipHeaders Authorization
```

To exclude all the `Request/Response Headers` from the final report, the following command can be used:

```console
newman run https://www.getpostman.com/collections/631643-f695cab7-6878-eb55-7943-ad88e1ccfd65-JsLv -r htmlextra --reporter-htmlextra-omitHeaders
```

To exclude all the `Request/Response Headers` and the `Request/Response Body` information from the final report, the following command can be used:

```console
newman run https://www.getpostman.com/collections/631643-f695cab7-6878-eb55-7943-ad88e1ccfd65-JsLv -r htmlextra --reporter-htmlextra-skipSensitiveData
```

To exclude a certain `Response Body` from the final report by passing in the name of the `Request`, the following command can be used:

```console
newman run https://www.getpostman.com/collections/631643-f695cab7-6878-eb55-7943-ad88e1ccfd65-JsLv --folder 'Authentication Methods' -r htmlextra --reporter-htmlextra-hideResponse 'Hawk Auth' 
```
---

To mask a certain `Key` from the final report response body by passing in the name of the `Key`, the following command can be used: 

```console
newman run https://www.getpostman.com/collections/631643-f695cab7-6878-eb55-7943-ad88e1ccfd65-JsLv --folder 'Authentication Methods' -r htmlextra --reporter-htmlextra-maskResponseKey 'access_token' 
```
---


#### With Newman as a Library

All the CLI functionality is available for programmatic use as well within a `nodejs` script.

```javascript
const newman = require('newman');

newman.run({
    collection: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Collection.json'), // can also provide a URL or path to a local JSON file.
    environment: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Environment.json'),
    reporters: 'htmlextra',
    reporter: {
        htmlextra: {
            export: './<html file path>', // If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory.
            template: '<template path>' // optional, the default template will be used if one is not specified
        }
    }
}, function (err) {
    if (err) { throw err; }
    console.log('collection run complete!');
});
```

Add the `showOnlyFails` property to the `htmlextra` object, to create a report showing only requests with test failures.

```javascript
const newman = require('newman');

newman.run({
    collection: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Collection.json'), // can also provide a URL or path to a local JSON file.
    environment: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Environment.json'),
    reporters: 'htmlextra',
    reporter: {
        htmlextra: {
            export: './<html file path>', // If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory.
            showOnlyFails: true // optional, tells the reporter to create a report showing only the requests with failed tests.
    }
}, function (err) {
    if (err) { throw err; }
    console.log('collection run complete!');
});
```

To use the `dark theme` template within a script - Add the `darkTheme` property to the `htmlextra` object. If the `template` option is also part of the object, this will overwrite the `darkTheme` option.

```javascript
const newman = require('newman');

newman.run({
    collection: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Collection.json'), // can also provide a URL or path to a local JSON file.
    environment: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Environment.json'),
    reporters: 'htmlextra',
    reporter: {
        htmlextra: {
            export: './<html file path>', // If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory.
            darkTheme: true // optional, tells the reporter to use the `Dark Theme` template
        }
    }
}, function (err) {
    if (err) { throw err; }
    console.log('collection run complete!');
});
```

Add the `title` property to the `htmlextra` object, to pass in your own custom title to the report.

```javascript
const newman = require('newman');

newman.run({
    collection: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Collection.json'), // can also provide a URL or path to a local JSON file.
    environment: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Environment.json'),
    reporters: 'htmlextra',
    reporter: {
        htmlextra: {
            export: './<html file path>', // If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory.
            title: 'My new report title' // optional, tells the reporter to use this as the main title in the centre of the report
        }
    }
}, function (err) {
    if (err) { throw err; }
    console.log('collection run complete!');
});
```

Add the `logs` property to the `htmlextra` object, to add console log statement output in the report.

```javascript
const newman = require('newman');

newman.run({
    collection: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Collection.json'), // can also provide a URL or path to a local JSON file.
    environment: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Environment.json'),
    reporters: 'htmlextra',
    reporter: {
        htmlextra: {
            export: './<html file path>', // If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory.
            logs: true // optional, tells the reporter to display the console log statements in the report. This is False by default.
        }
    }
}, function (err) {
    if (err) { throw err; }
    console.log('collection run complete!');
});
```

Add the `skipHeaders` property to the `htmlextra` object, to pass in an array of header names. It will then not output those headers and their values to the report, for both requests and responses.

```javascript
const newman = require('newman');

newman.run({
    collection: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Collection.json'), // can also provide a URL or path to a local JSON file.
    environment: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Environment.json'),
    reporters: 'htmlextra',
    reporter: {
        htmlextra: {
            export: './<html file path>', // If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory.
            skipHeaders: [ 'Server', 'Authorization', 'X-Powered-By' ] // optional, tells the reporter to not output these headers and their values in the report. This is false by default.
        }
    }
}, function (err) {
    if (err) { throw err; }
    console.log('collection run complete!');
});
```

Add the `omitHeaders` property to the `htmlextra` object, to exclude all the request and response headers.

```javascript
const newman = require('newman');

newman.run({
    collection: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Collection.json'), // can also provide a URL or path to a local JSON file.
    environment: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Environment.json'),
    reporters: 'htmlextra',
    reporter: {
        htmlextra: {
            export: './<html file path>', // If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory.
            omitHeaders: true // optional, tells the reporter not to output the headers for each request and response in the report. This is false by default.
        }
    }
}, function (err) {
    if (err) { throw err; }
    console.log('collection run complete!');
});
```
Add the `hideResponse` property to the `htmlextra` object, to pass in an array of `Request` names. It will then not include the `Response Body` for those requests.

```javascript
const newman = require('newman');

newman.run({
    collection: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Collection.json'), // can also provide a URL or path to a local JSON file.
    environment: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Environment.json'),
    reporters: 'htmlextra',
    reporter: {
        htmlextra: {
            export: './<html file path>', // If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory.
            hideResponse: [ 'Ping the API'], // optional, tells the reporter to not output the response body of the request in the report.
        }
    }
}, function (err) {
    if (err) { throw err; }
    console.log('collection run complete!');
});
```

Add the `maskResponseKey` property to the `htmlextra` object, to pass in an array of `Key` names of the response. It will then mask the value of the key with `********` in the response body.

```javascript
const newman = require('newman');

newman.run({
    collection: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Collection.json'), // can also provide a URL or path to a local JSON file.
    environment: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Environment.json'),
    reporters: 'htmlextra',
    reporter: {
        htmlextra: {
            export: './<html file path>', // If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory.
            maskResponseKey: [ 'Key value in the response'], // optional, tells the reporter to mask the value of key with `******` in response body of the request in the report.
        }
    }
}, function (err) {
    if (err) { throw err; }
    console.log('collection run complete!');
});
```

Add the `skipSensitiveData` property to the `htmlextra` object, to exclude headers and bodies in all requests and responses.

```javascript
const newman = require('newman');

newman.run({
    collection: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Collection.json'), // can also provide a URL or path to a local JSON file.
    environment: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Environment.json'),
    reporters: 'htmlextra',
    reporter: {
        htmlextra: {
            export: './<html file path>', // If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory.
            skipSensitiveData: true // optional, tells the reporter not to output headers and bodies for each request and response in the report. This is false by default.
        }
    }
}, function (err) {
    if (err) { throw err; }
    console.log('collection run complete!');
});
```

## Report Examples

### Dark Theme

![Dark Theme Request View](./examples/Dark_Theme_Request_View.PNG)

### Show Only Failures

If you have multiple requests in your collections the report can become quite verbose, I've added a flag option to just create the report with only the requests that have `Failed` tests. This is very similar to the default report but the folders will already be expanded, if their are any failed tests.

### Console Logs

The `console.log()` statements used in the Collections are shown in the main request view, these were previously separated out into its own section but these have been now brought together and part of the request that they relate too.

## Special mention

This work have been hugely inspired and copied several aspects of the great work done by [Martijn Vander Vlag](https://github.com/martijnvandervlag) to create the [newman-reporter-htmlfull](https://github.com/martijnvandervlag/newman-reporter-htmlfull) package. Check out that package too, this contains many of the same features.

It was also brought together by reviewing the feature requests, from the official Postman HTML reporter.
