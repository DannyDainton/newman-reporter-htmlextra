A [Newman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman) HTML reporter that has been extended to include the separation of the iteration runs so these are no longer aggregated together and also some additional `handlebars helpers` to enable users to create better custom templates. This reporter comes with a default dashboard style template and also a `Dark Theme` version that can be switched using a CLI flag.

---

## Some of the Extras

- Full separated iterations runs and not aggregated stats - Default template shows iteration number in heading
- Includes the full [handlebars-helpers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars-helpers) module for building better templates
- New `percent` helper to help exposing data like `Test Pass Percentage` - e.g `{{percent cumulativeTests.passed cumulativeTests.failed}}`
- Copy and Paste any of the Response Bodies
- Includes an `inc` helper to work with things like the handlebars zero index - e.g `Iteration:{{inc cursor.iteration}} - {{item.name}}`
- Added the [helper-moment](https://github.com/helpers/helper-moment) module so you have more control over the display dates - e.g `{{moment date format="dddd, DD MMMM YYYY HH:mm:ss"}}`
- Exposed the `Skipped Tests` so you can tell which ones are skipped, in the main summary view. You can also see which tests are skipped within the single request view
- Folder level descriptions with rendered Markdown syntax
- Response Headers displayed for each of the requests
- Iterations separated by tabs in the `Requests` view
- First attempt to add the `console.log` statements, using the `--reporter-htmlextra-logs` CLI flag - These are currently separate from the parent requests but it's the first step in getting them on the report
- A `Dark Theme` dashboard template - This is an option from the CLI using the `--reporter-htmlextra-darkTheme` flag or in a script by setting the `darkTheme` property to `true`.
- A `helper` to give more control over the main `title` shown on the report. Use the `--reporter-htmlextra-title` flag to add your own unique headline.
- The default filename, if you do not supply the `export` location, is now includes the collection name in the filename rather that the reporter name.
- Use the `onlyShowFails` option to reduce the report down to just showing the requests that had test failures.
- The `skipHeaders` option lets you optionally specify an array of header names that should be skipped in the report.
- Setting the `skipSensitiveData` will skip outputting the headers and bodies for all requests and responses.
- More to come...

## Interactive Report Examples

To give you an idea of what the final reports will look like, I've added a few working examples here:

- [All the Tests Passing](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/newman-htmlextra-reports/All_Passed.html)
- [Failed and Skipped Tests during the Collection run](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/newman-htmlextra-reports/Fails_And_Skips.html)
- [The Dark Theme version of the final report](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/newman-htmlextra-reports/Dark_Theme.html)

These a _just_ a few of the reports that can be produced from the reporter. You will find more options available to help configure the final output, in the sections below.

## Install

> The installation should be global if newman is installed globally, local otherwise.

For `global` install:

```console
npm install -g newman-reporter-htmlextra
```

For `local` install:

```console
npm install -D newman-reporter-htmlextra
```

## Usage

In order to enable this reporter, specify `htmlextra` in Newman's `-r` or `--reporters` option.

```console
newman run https://www.getpostman.com/collections/631643-f695cab7-6878-eb55-7943-ad88e1ccfd65-JsLv -r htmlextra
```

### Options

#### With Newman CLI

| CLI Option  | Description       |
|-------------|-------------------|
| `--reporter-htmlextra-export <path>` | Specify a path where the output HTML file will be written to disk. If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory. |
| `--reporter-htmlextra-template <path>` | Specify a path to the custom template which will be used to render the HTML report. This option depends on `--reporter htmlextra` and `--reporter-htmlextra-export` being present in the run command. If this option is not specified, the [default template](./lib/dashboard-template.hbs) is used |
| `--reporter-htmlextra-showOnlyFails` | Use this optional flag to tell the reporter to display only the requests with failed tests. |
| `--reporter-htmlextra-darkTheme` | Use this optional flag to switch the reporter template to the `Dark Theme` dashboard. |
| `--reporter-htmlextra-testPaging` | Use this optional flag to add pagination to the tests in the request view. |
| `--reporter-htmlextra-browserTitle` | Use this optional flag to change the name of the title in the browser tab. The default name is "Newman Summary Report". |
| `--reporter-htmlextra-title` | This optional flag can be used to give your report a different main `Title` in the centre of the report. If this is not set, the report will show "Newman Run Dashboard". |
| `--reporter-htmlextra-titleSize` | An optional flag to reduce the size of the main report title. The sizes range from `1` to `6`, the higher the number, the smaller the title will be. The default size is `2`. |
| `--reporter-htmlextra-logs` | This optional flag shows any console log statements in the collection, on the final report. This is `false` by default. |
| `--reporter-htmlextra-skipHeaders` | An optional flag which allows you to exclude certain `Headers` from the final report |
| `--reporter-htmlextra-skipSensitiveData` | An optional flag that will exclude all the `Request/Response Headers` and the `Request/Response bodies`, from each request in the final report. This will only show the main request info and the Test Results. This is `false` by default. |

Custom templates (currently handlebars only) can be passed to the HTML reporter via `--reporter-htmlextra-template <path>` with `--reporters htmlextra` and `--reporter-htmlextra-export`.
The [default template](./lib/dashboard-template.hbs) is used in all other cases.

To create a report that only shows the requests with `Failed` tests, from the CLI, the following command can be used:

```console
newman run https://www.getpostman.com/collections/631643-f695cab7-6878-eb55-7943-ad88e1ccfd65-JsLv -r htmlextra --reporter-htmlextra-showOnlyFails
```

To create the `Dark Theme` report from the CLI, the following command can be used:

```console
newman run https://www.getpostman.com/collections/631643-f695cab7-6878-eb55-7943-ad88e1ccfd65-JsLv -r htmlextra --reporter-htmlextra-darkTheme
```

To add a custom `Title` to your report from the CLI, the following command can be used:

```console
newman run https://www.getpostman.com/collections/631643-f695cab7-6878-eb55-7943-ad88e1ccfd65-JsLv -r htmlextra --reporter-htmlextra-title "My new report title"
```

To show the `console.log()` statements on the report from the CLI, the following command can be used:

```console
newman run https://www.getpostman.com/collections/631643-f695cab7-6878-eb55-7943-ad88e1ccfd65-JsLv -r htmlextra --reporter-htmlextra-logs
```

To exclude a certain `Header` from the final report, the following command can be used:

```console
newman run https://www.getpostman.com/collections/631643-f695cab7-6878-eb55-7943-ad88e1ccfd65-JsLv --folder 'Authentication Methods' -r htmlextra --reporter-htmlextra-skipHeaders Authorization
```

To exclude all the `Request/Response Headers` and the `Request/Response Body` information from the final report, the following command can be used:

```console
newman run https://www.getpostman.com/collections/631643-f695cab7-6878-eb55-7943-ad88e1ccfd65-JsLv -r htmlextra --reporter-htmlextra-skipSensitiveData
```


#### With Newman as a Library

All the CLI functionality is available for programmatic use as well within a `nodejs` script.

```javascript
const newman = require('newman');

newman.run({
    collection: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Collection.json'), // can also provide a URL or path to a local JSON file.
    environment: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Environment.json'),
    reporters: 'htmlextra',
    reporter: {
        htmlextra: {
            export: './<html file path>', // If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory.
            template: '<template path>' // optional, the default template will be used if one is not specified
        }
    }
}, function (err) {
    if (err) { throw err; }
    console.log('collection run complete!');
});
```

Add the `showOnlyFails` property to the `htmlextra` object, to create a report showing only requests with test failures.

```javascript
const newman = require('newman');

newman.run({
    collection: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Collection.json'), // can also provide a URL or path to a local JSON file.
    environment: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Environment.json'),
    reporters: 'htmlextra',
    reporter: {
        htmlextra: {
            export: './<html file path>', // If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory.
            showOnlyFails: true // optional, tells the reporter to create a report showing only the requests with failed tests.
    }
}, function (err) {
    if (err) { throw err; }
    console.log('collection run complete!');
});
```

To use the `dark theme` template within a script - Add the `darkTheme` property to the `htmlextra` object. If the `template` option is also part of the object, this will overwrite the `darkTheme` option.

```javascript
const newman = require('newman');

newman.run({
    collection: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Collection.json'), // can also provide a URL or path to a local JSON file.
    environment: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Environment.json'),
    reporters: 'htmlextra',
    reporter: {
        htmlextra: {
            export: './<html file path>', // If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory.
            darkTheme: true // optional, tells the reporter to use the `Dark Theme` template
        }
    }
}, function (err) {
    if (err) { throw err; }
    console.log('collection run complete!');
});
```

Add the `title` property to the `htmlextra` object, to pass in your own custom title to the report.

```javascript
const newman = require('newman');

newman.run({
    collection: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Collection.json'), // can also provide a URL or path to a local JSON file.
    environment: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Environment.json'),
    reporters: 'htmlextra',
    reporter: {
        htmlextra: {
            export: './<html file path>', // If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory.
            title: 'My new report title' // optional, tells the reporter to use this as the main title in the centre of the report
        }
    }
}, function (err) {
    if (err) { throw err; }
    console.log('collection run complete!');
});
```

Add the `logs` property to the `htmlextra` object, to add console log statement output in the report.

```javascript
const newman = require('newman');

newman.run({
    collection: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Collection.json'), // can also provide a URL or path to a local JSON file.
    environment: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Environment.json'),
    reporters: 'htmlextra',
    reporter: {
        htmlextra: {
            export: './<html file path>', // If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory.
            logs: true // optional, tells the reporter to display the console log statements in the report. This is False by default.
        }
    }
}, function (err) {
    if (err) { throw err; }
    console.log('collection run complete!');
});
```

Add the `skipHeaders` property to the `htmlextra` object, to pass in an array of header names. It will then not output those headers and their values to the report, for both requests and responses.

```javascript
const newman = require('newman');

newman.run({
    collection: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Collection.json'), // can also provide a URL or path to a local JSON file.
    environment: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Environment.json'),
    reporters: 'htmlextra',
    reporter: {
        htmlextra: {
            export: './<html file path>', // If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory.
            skipHeaders: [ 'Server', 'Authorization', 'X-Powered-By' ] // optional, tells the reporter to not output these headers and their values in the report. This is False by default.
        }
    }
}, function (err) {
    if (err) { throw err; }
    console.log('collection run complete!');
});
```

Add the `skipSensitiveData` property to the `htmlextra` object, to exclude headers and bodies in all requests and responses.

```javascript
const newman = require('newman');

newman.run({
    collection: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Collection.json'), // can also provide a URL or path to a local JSON file.
    environment: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Environment.json'),
    reporters: 'htmlextra',
    reporter: {
        htmlextra: {
            export: './<html file path>', // If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory.
            skipSensitiveData: true // optional, tells the not to output headers and bodies for each request and response in the report. This is False by default.
        }
    }
}, function (err) {
    if (err) { throw err; }
    console.log('collection run complete!');
});
```

### Show Only Failures

If you have multiple requests in your collections the report can become quite verbose, I've added a flag option to just create the report with only the requests that have `Failed` tests. This is very similar to the default report but the folders will already be expanded, if their are any failed tests.

![Failed Requests View](./examples/Failed_Requests_View.PNG)

Add the `darkTheme` flag to see this in the `dark` view.

![Failed Requests Dark View](./examples/Failed_Requests_Dark_View.PNG)

### Console Logs

This is the first attempt to expose any `console.log` statements that are really useful to have in your `Requests`. The event from Newman doesn't contain a lot of detail about the request that it was part of and this will involve, in it's current state a horrible hacky fix to map things together. In the meantime, the Postman `pm.info` function provides these for you and can just be added to the `console.log` statement, as workaround. Something like `${pm.info.requestName} | ${pm.info.eventName} | Iteration: ${pm.info.iteration + 1}` will log out the missing event information.

If the collection contains Console Logs and you use the `--reporter-htmlextra-logs` flag, a new tab will appear, that will show all the details. This information is displayed in a similar way that you may have seen on the `Failed Tests` and `Skipped Tests`.

## Special mention

This work have been hugely inspired and copied several aspects of the great work done by [Martijn Vander Vlag](https://github.com/martijnvandervlag) to create the [newman-reporter-htmlfull](https://github.com/martijnvandervlag/newman-reporter-htmlfull) package. Check out that package too, this contains many of the same features.

It was also brought together by reviewing some of the feature requests, for the official Postman HTML reporter.
